## Features

- Seasonal flavor management
- Ingredient inventory tracking
- Customer cart functionality
- Allergen management
- Flavor suggestions system
- Search and filter capabilities

## Installation

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Docker Setup

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t ice-cream-parlor .
   ```
2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 ice-cream-parlor
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Flavors
- GET `/flavors` - List all flavors
  - Query parameters:
    - `seasonal` (boolean): Filter seasonal flavors
    - `search` (string): Search flavors by name

### Allergens
- GET `/allergens` - List all allergens
- POST `/allergens` - Add new allergen
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Allergen Name"
  }
  ```

### Cart
- GET `/cart/<user_id>` - Get user's cart
- POST `/cart/<user_id>` - Add item to cart
  ```json
  {
    "flavor_id": 1
  }
  ```
- DELETE `/cart/<user_id>?flavor_id=1` - Remove item from cart

### Suggestions
- POST `/suggestions` - Submit flavor suggestion
  ```json
  {
    "flavor_name": "New Flavor",
    "description": "Flavor description",
    "allergens": "Comma-separated allergens"
  }
  ```

## Testing

To test the application functionality:

1. Start the application
2. Test the following scenarios:
   - Add and retrieve flavors
   - Search flavors by name
   - Filter seasonal flavors
   - Add items to cart
   - Remove items from cart
   - Add new allergens
   - Submit flavor suggestions

## Database Schema

The application uses SQLite with the following models:
- Flavor
- Ingredient
- Allergen
- Cart
- Suggestion

## Code Documentation

The codebase is organized into several modules:
- `app/__init__.py`: Application factory and database initialization
- `app/models.py`: SQLAlchemy models
- `app/routes.py`: API endpoints
- `app/utils.py`: Utility functions and sample data initialization

Each module and function includes docstrings and comments explaining their purpose and usage.

# Code Improvements

## Improved Code Structure

The codebase can be improved by adding more descriptive comments and docstrings. Additionally, the code can be organized into more modules to improve readability and maintainability.

## Error Handling

Error handling can be improved by adding try-except blocks to handle potential errors. This will prevent the application from crashing in case of an error.

## Security

The application can be secured by adding authentication and authorization mechanisms. This will prevent unauthorized access to the application.

## Performance

The application's performance can be improved by optimizing database queries and using caching mechanisms.

## Testing

The application's testing can be improved by adding more test cases to cover different scenarios. This will ensure that the application is thoroughly tested and works as expected.

## Code Refactoring

The code can be refactored to improve readability and maintainability. This can be done by renaming variables and functions to make them more descriptive, and by removing redundant code.

## Code Review

The code can be reviewed to ensure that it follows best practices and coding standards. This can be done by using code review tools and by having other developers review the code.

## Code Optimization

The code can be optimized to improve performance. This can be done by using optimization techniques such as caching, memoization, and parallel processing.

## Code Deployment

The code can be deployed to a production environment to make it available to users. This can be done by using deployment tools such as Docker and Kubernetes.

## Code Monitoring

The code can be monitored to ensure that it is working as expected. This can be done by using monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana.

## Code Maintenance

The code can be maintained to ensure that it continues to work as expected. This can be done by regularly updating dependencies, fixing bugs, and adding new features.# Ice Cream Parlor Application
